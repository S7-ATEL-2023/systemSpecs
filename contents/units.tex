\section{Units}
Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are strongly 
encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). 
This applies to papers in data storage. For example, write ``15 
Gb/cm$^{2}$ (100 Gb/in$^{2})$.'' An exception is when 
English units are used as identifiers in trade, such as ``3\textonehalf-in 
disk drive.'' Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes 
and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because 
equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly 
state the units for each quantity in an equation.

The SI unit for magnetic field strength $H$ is A/m. However, if you wish to use 
units of T, either refer to magnetic flux density $B$ or magnetic field 
strength symbolized as $\mu _{0}H$. Use the center dot to separate 
compound units, e.g., ``A$\cdot $m$^{2}$.''
