\IEEEPARstart {T}{his} document describes the specifications of the optical 
multiplexer/demultiplexer Group 6 of advanced telecommunications will simulate.
Before a system can be designed, it has to be clear what area it entails, what existing techniques
are already developed and what the limitations of the method are.
To start, the goal of a multiplexer is to take multiple signals, make one signal out of them
and send them over one carrier at the same time. Multiplexing a signal allows less
infrastructure to send more data simultaneously. Alternate ways of describing a multiplexer
and demultiplexer are MISO and MOSI, or Multiple In, Single Out and Multiple Out, Single In
respectively. Multiplexing is a long existing technique used in wired, wireless and optical 
connections. Focussing on the optical side of things, there are two main ways of multiplexing:
directly multiplexing optical signals and converting them to electronic signals(O/E), 
multiplexing them and converting them back to optical signals(E/O). For more information 
about optical multiplexing and systems, read the rest of the document.
